== Introduction

Hello fellow University friends! Have you ever found writing resumes
for job and internship applications a hassle? Have you ever dreamt about
an app that can help you manage different resumes for different companies?
Have you ever wished for a more streamlined *Command Line Interface*
application that can match your efficiency and typing prowess?

If this sounds like you, *ResuMe* is _the_ resume managing application for you!
Made by University students for University students with _looovee_, this wonder
understands your struggle and strives to cater to your specific resume needs
and job application woes.

=== Overview
*ResuMe* allows the management of five different item types:

[source,sh]
[cols="^.^10%,^.^10%,^.^20%,.^60%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|No. |Item type |Alias |Attributes
|1 |internship |int |name, role, from, to, description, tag

|2 |project |proj |name, time, website, description, tag

|3 |skill |ski |name, level, tag

|4 |resume |res |name, description, tag

|5 |note |note |name, time
|=======================================================================

As you may have noticed from number 4, we are able to manage different `resumes` as well!
Items from number 1 to 3 can be shared across different `resumes`.

=== Preview
The following is the GUI for our application:

image::GUI.png[width="790"]

****
The GUI includes:

. *Command box:* where you enter your commands.

. *Result box:* where the result of a command is shown. It can show a success message or a failure
message if something wrong happens.

. *View box:* where the detailed information about an item is shown. For instance, if you are viewing an
`internship` item, this box shows in full the `company name`, `role`, `from`, `to`, `description` and `tags`.

. *List box:* where all items of a type are listed. Only one type is displayed at a time. You can change
the view of this list using `list` command. Additionally, when other commands change items of a type,
the list box will be set to display that type.

. *User box:* where you can view your personal information like name, email address, or phone number. Any changes made
to your user profile will be automatically reflected here.

== About this guide
Our aim when writing this document is to help you - a new user - get started with *ResuMe* as quickly as possible.
The guide features all the available commands, their syntax, as well as specific examples for illustration.

This section is, well... a guide on how to use this guide :) We will be explaining some of the symbols and formatting used, key terms,
as well notes and tips for a better user experience.

=== Symbols and Formatting
Most of us are visual learners, and we figured, what is a better way to present information than using some shapes and colours?

[width="100%",cols="^.^20%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Symbol / Format|Explanation
|icon:info-circle[role="blue"] | Important information to take note
|icon:lightbulb-o[role="yellow"] | Tips
|icon:exclamation-triangle[role="red"] | Warnings on potential misuse
|`consola font` | Keywords you could type in the command box and could be be executed by the application
|=======================================================================

=== Key terms
You will come across these little guys a lot in this document, so let's get to know them first!
[width="100%",cols="^.^20%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Term |Explanation
|`type` | Consisting of five different types: `internship`, `project`, `skill`, `resume` or `note`
|`item` | An item stored in the application, which could be any one of the five types above
|`command` | A line of text that you could type into the command box and execute
|`parameter` | Specific information about an `item` supplied by you
|`index` | The position of the `item` in the currently displayed list
|=======================================================================

// end::guide[]

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `resumebook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your *ResuMe* application.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Try out these example commands:

* **`list`**`i/ res` : lists all `resumes`.
* **`add`**`i/ res n/ Software Engineering Resume #/SE #frontend`: adds a `resume` named `Software Engineering Resume`.
* **`delete`**`1 i/ res` : deletes the 1st `resume` shown in the current list.
* *`exit`* : exits the app.

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the you. +
For example in `add i/ TYPE n/ NAME`, `TYPE` and `NAME` are parameters which can be customised to be `add i/ proj n/ Orbital`.
* Parameters in square brackets are optional. +
 For example, `n/ NAME [#/TAG]` can be used as `n/ Orbital #/ SE` or as `n/ Orbital`.
* Parameters with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times. +
 For example, `[#/ TAG]...` can be used as:
** (i.e. 0 times)
** `#/ friend`
** `#/ friend #/ family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order. +
 For example, if the command specifies `n/ NAME p/ PHONE`, `p/ PHONE_NUMBER n/ NAME` is also acceptable.
====

// tag::help[]
=== Viewing help : `help`

Lists out the function and usage of each command.
****
*Format:* `help OPTION`
****

There are two possible `help` options that you can choose from, as shown in the table below:
[width="100%",cols="^.^15%,^.^25%,60%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Option |Format |Result
|command |`help command` |Opens a pop-up window with a summary of available commands, their syntax and usages.
|start |`help start` |Opens a pop-up window with detailed guide on how to get started.
|=======================================================================

// end::help[]

=== Edit user profile: `me`

Edits and updates user's display information.

[NOTE]
A user profile contains the following fields: `Display Picture`, `Name`, `Description`, `Phone`, `Email`, `Github`, `University`, `Major`, `From`, `To`, `CAP`.

****
*Format:* `me [dp/ FILE_PATH] [n/ NAME] [d/ DESCRIPTION] [p/ PHONE] [e/ EMAIL] [g/ GITHUB] [u/ UNIVERSITY] [m/ MAJOR] [f/ FROM] [t/ TO] [c/ CURRENT_CAP MAX_CAP]`
****

*Example 1:* Update user profile details +

Try typing in the command box this command:

`me n/ My Name p/ 12345678 e/ test@gmail.com d/ I like solving problems and creating things! g/ mygithub u/ NUS m/ CS f/ 08-2018 t/ 05-2022 c/ 5.0 5.0`

*Outcome:*

The user box is updated accordingly as below.

// TODO: update screenshot
image::user_profile.png[width="400"]

*Example 2:* Update user profile picture

Follow the steps in one of these two links to copy a file path according to your respective Operating System.

. Mac: https://osxdaily.com/2013/06/19/copy-file-folder-path-mac-os-x/

. Windows: https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/show-full-folder-path-file-explorer

Afterwards, try a command similar to the one below:

`me dp/ /Users/nhamquochung/Desktop/test.png`

*Outcome:*

The user profile picture is updated accordingly as below.

// TODO: update screenshot
image::user_profile1.png[width="400"]

=== Listing all items : `list`

List items in the storage.

****
*Format:* `list i/ TYPE`
****

[TIP]
Listed items are in short form, only showing their name, index, `tags` and a short summary.
To view items in full details, use `view`.

*Examples:*

//TODO: add screenshots

* `list i/ res`
Lists all `resume` items.
* `list i/ proj`
Lists all project items.

// tag::add[]
=== Adding an item: `add`

Adds an item to the *ResuMe* application.

[NOTE]
--
* An item could be one of the five item types: `internship`, `project`, `skill`, `note` or even `resume` itself. +
* A newly added note will be automatically marked as `undone`.
--

****
*Format:* `add i/ TYPE n/ NAME [ATTRIBUTE/ VALUE]... [#/ TAG]...`
****

[TIP]
An item could have any number of tags _(including 0)_.

The specific command syntax could be found in the table below:

[width="100%",cols="^12%,88%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Type |Format
|Internship | `add i/ int n/ COMPANY_NAME r/ ROLE f/ FROM t/ TO d/ DESCRIPTION [#/ TAG]...`

|Skill |`add i/ ski n/ SKILL_NAME l/ LEVEL [#/ TAG]....`

|Resume |`add i/ res n/ RESUME_NAME [#/ TAG]...`

|Note |`add i/ note n/ NOTE_NAME t/ TIME`
|=======================================================================

[NOTE]
There are three possible levels for a `skill` item: `ADVANCED`, `INTERMEDIATE` and `BASIC`.
[TIP]
The description of an item could be written in one paragraph (with *full stop* and a *space* after each sentence).
These sentences, when exported to `.pdf` format, will be automatically shown as individual bullet points!
_(refer to <<Generating a resume: `rgen`, rgen>> for more details)_

*Example:* Try typing in the command box these two commands one by one!

. `list i/ proj`
. `add i/ proj n/ Duke t/ 06-2020 w/ abc.github.io d/ For a little module named CS2103T. #/ java #/ tech`

*Outcome:*

. All project items are listed in the list box.
+
image::ListProject.png[width="790"]
. A new project item named `Duke` with the specified fields is added. This item is automatically reflected in the list box.
+
image::AddDukeProject.png[width="790"]

// end::add[]

=== Editing an item : `edit`

Edits an existing item in the *ResuMe* application.

[NOTE]
`edit` is a different command from `redit`. Please visit <<FAQ, FAQ>> for more information.

**Format:**

****
`edit INDEX i/ TYPE [ATTRIBUTE/ VALUE]... [#/ TAG]...`
****


[width="100%",cols="^.^16%,84%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Type |Format
|Internship |`edit INDEX i/ int [n/ COMPANY_NAME] [r/ ROLE] [f/ FROM] [t/ TO] [d/ DESCRIPTION] [#/ TAG]...`

|Project |`edit INDEX i/ proj [n/ PROJECT_NAME] [t/ TIME] [w/ WEBSITE] [d/ DESCRIPTION] [#/ TAG]....`

|Skill |`edit INDEX i/ ski [n/ SKILL_NAME] [l/ LEVEL] [#/ TAG]....`

|Resume |`edit INDEX i/ res [n/ RESUME_NAME] [#/ TAG]...`

|Note |`edit INDEX i/ note [n/ NOTE_NAME] [t/ TIME] [#/ TAG]...`
|=======================================================================


*Example 1:* Try typing in the command box these two commands one by one!

. `list i/ res`
. `edit 1 i/ res n/ Software Engineering Resume #/ agile`

*Outcome:*

. All `resume` items are listed in the list box.
+
image::ListResume2.png[width="790"]
. The `resume` at index 1 has its name changed from "Resume 2" to "Software Engineering Resume" and its
tag set to "agile".
+
image::EditResumeExample.png[width="790"]

*Example 2:* Try typing in the command box these two commands one by one!

. `list i/ ski`
. `edit 2 i/ ski l/ ADVANCED #/`

*Outcome:*

. All skill items are listed in the list box.
+
// TODO: add screenshot

. The `skill` at index 2 has its level changed to `ADVANCED` and all its existing tags cleared.
+
// TODO: add screenshot

=== Finding items by name: `find`

Finds items of a specific `type` in the *ResuMe* application whose names contain the specified keyword(s).

[NOTE]
An item could be one of the five item types: `internship`, `project`, `skill`, `resume` or `note`.

****
*Format:* `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]... i/ TYPE`
****

The specific command syntax could be found in the table below:

[width="100%",cols="^.^12%,88%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Type |Format
|Internship | `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]... i/ int`

|Project |`find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]... i/ proj`

|Skill |`find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]... i/ ski`

|Resume |`find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]... i/ res`

|Note |`find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]... i/ note`
|=======================================================================

*Example:* Try typing in the command box these commands one by one!

. `list i/ proj`
. `add i/ proj n/ Duke t/ 06-2020 w/ abc.github.io d/ For a little module named CS2103T. #/ java #/ tech`
. `find Duke i/ proj`

*Outcome*

// TODO: add screenshot
. All `project` items are listed in the list box.
. A new `project` with the specified details is added.
. `Projects` whose names match keywords are listed in the list box.
+
image::find_command.png[width="790"]

// tag::delete[]

=== Deleting an item : `delete`

Deletes an item from the *ResuMe* application.

****
*Format:* `delete INDEX i/ TYPE`
****

[NOTE]
The `INDEX` argument comes before the `TYPE` argument.

[TIP]
Use `list` command to navigate to the correct list to ensure that 1) the item exists, and 2) you know the
correct `index` for deletion. Or just fall back on `undo` if you accidentally delete the wrong item.

Deleting an item will set the list box to display items of its type.
If the item is an `internship`, a `project`, or a `skill`, all `resumes` that contain it will also be updated to
reflect the change.

*Example:*

. Suppose we start with the following original list of `resumes`, as seen using the command `list i/ res`.
+

image::BeforeDeleteResumeList.png[width="790"]

. Delete the 2nd `resume` with `delete 2 i/ res` .
+

image::ResumeDelete2.png[width="790"]

. Delete the 3rd skill with `delete 3 i/ ski` . Do note how it is not a must for the list box to display skills for
deletion to proceed.
+

image::DeleteSkill3.png[width="790"]

// end::delete[]

// tag::view[]
=== Viewing an item in details: `view`

Shows the details of an item.

****
*Format:* `view INDEX i/ TYPE`
****

[TIP]
Certain details of specific items, for example the `website` and `description` of a `project` can only be viewed by using this command.

*Example:* Try typing in the command box these two commands one by one!

. `list i/ proj`
. `view 2 i/ proj`

*Outcome:*

. All `project` items are listed in the list box.
+
image::ListProject2.png[width="790"]
. Full details of the `project` at index 2 are displayed in the view box. These includes details that were not shown
in the list box, such as its website (_"abc.github.io"_) and its description (_"For a little module named CS2103T"_).
+
image::ViewDukeProject.png[width="790"]

// end::view[]

// tag::redit[]
=== Editing a resume: `redit`
Edits the content of a `resume` to contain the items specified in the command.

[NOTE]
`redit` is a different command from `edit`. Please visit <<FAQ, FAQ>> for more information.

****
*Format:* `redit RESUME_INDEX TYPE/ [ITEM_INDEX...] [MORE_TYPE/ [ITEM_INDEX...]]`
****

[TIP]
If you find it a hassle to manually enter items into the `resume`, you can consider using <<Pulling tagged items into the resume: `tagpull`, tagpull>>!

* For each `TYPE`, existing items will be updated to the input items.
* You can add multiple items of a certain type to a `resume` by chaining
`ITEM_INDEX` after `TYPE/`. +
  For example `proj/ 3 6`, will add `project` item of indices 3 and 6 to the `resume`.
* You can remove all items of type `TYPE` by typing `TYPE/` without specifying any `ITEM_INDEX` after it.

*Example 1:*

`redit 1 int/ 1 proj/ 1 ski/ 1 2`

*Outcome:*

The content of the `resume` at index 1 is modified. The `resume` now contains the `internship` item at index 1,
`project` item at index 1, and `skill` items at indices 1 and 2. The following screenshot illustrates what happens in the list box:

image::ReditAddIntoResume.png[AddIntoResume,442,337]

*Example 2:*

`redit 1 int/ proj/ ski/`

*Outcome:*

The content of the `resume` at index 1 is modified and now contains no `internship`, `project` or `skill` items.
The following screenshot illustrates what happens to the list box:

image::ReditRemoveEverything.png[RemoveEverything,442,337]

*Example 3:*

`redit 1 int/ 1 proj/ ski/ 2`

*Outcome:*

The content of the `resume` at index 1 is modified and now contains `internship` item at index 1, no `project` items,
and `skill` item at index 2. The following screenshot illustrates what can happen.

__(take note that initially the `resume` may contain an entirely different set of items)__

image::ReditWantSomeThings.png[WantSomeThings,442,337]

// end::redit[]

// tag::tagpull[]
=== Pulling tagged items into the resume: `tagpull`

Pull the `internship`, `project` and `skill` items with the specified tag(s) into a `resume`.

****
*Format:* `tagpull INDEX [#/ TAG]`
****

[NOTE]
This command does not remove items from the `resume` and will add items on top of the existing items.

*Example 1:*

`tagpull 1 #/ tech`

*Outcome:*

The `resume` at index 1 is modified. On top of the existing items, all `internship`, `project`, and `skill` items with
the tag `tech` are added into the `resume`.

// TODO: add screenshot

*Example 2:*

`tagpull 2 #/ tech frontend`

*Outcome:*

The `resume` at index 2 is modified. On top of the existing items, all `internship`, `project`, and `skill` items with
either the tag `tech` or `frontend` are added into the `resume`.

// TODO: add screenshot

// end::tagpull[]

// tag::undo[]

=== Undo a command: `undo`

Undoes the previous command and restores the state of the application to before that command is performed.

****
*Format:* `undo`
****

[NOTE]
--
* An `undo` is done per command and not change.

* Commands that can be undone are: `add`, `delete`, `edit`, `redit`, `tagpull` and `me`.

* Commands that make no change to the application state, like `list`, `view`, `find`, `rpreview` or `rgen`, cannot be undone.

* Successive `undo` commands will bring the application further back, until there is no more change to `undo`.

* You cannot `undo` if there is no previous state to return to.
--

*Example:*

. Suppose we hate Java and therefore want to delete it from the list of skills using a `delete 2 i/ ski` command. We
also do a `list i/ proj` to switch to viewing projects because this is how staging for an example works.
+

image::deleteJava_beforeUndo.png[width="790"]
+

image::beforeUndo_switchToProj.png[width="790"]

. But Stockholm's syndrome kicks in and we decide that Java has its merits, so we revert our action with `undo`.
Voila, Java is back, and our list box now displays skills.
+

image::postUndo_JavaIsBack.png[width="790"]

// end::undo[]

// tag::redo[]

=== Redo a command: `redo`

Reverts the most recent undone command and brings the application state to after the (re)execution
of that command.

****
*Format:* `redo`
****

[NOTE]
--
* A redo is done per command and not change.

* If a new `add`, `delete`, `edit`, `redit`, `tagpull` or `me` command is performed after an `undo`,
then all `redo` states will be deleted and you will not be able to go to these states.

* You cannot `redo` if there is no forward state to go to.
--

*Example:*

After with the Java deletion incidence in the previous section (on `undo`), we decide that the merits of Java
do not warrant the pain that comes along with it and so we want to use `redo` our original choice . Afterwards, Java is
once again removed from our life.

image::redo_success.png[width="790"]

// end::redo[]

=== Previewing a resume: `rpreview`

Previews a `resume` in text format in a pop-up window.

****
*Format:* `rpreview INDEX`
****

[NOTE]
`INDEX` is the index of the `resume` seen when `list i/res` is called.

*Example:*

`rpreview 2`

*Outcome:*

Suppose the `resume` at index 2 is named "Summer Internship". A pop-up window will be opened,
featuring a text-based view of the content of "Summer Internship".

image::RPreviewSummerInternship.png[width = "790"]

// tag::rgen[]

=== Generating a resume: `rgen`
Generates a `.pdf` file from an existing `resume` stored inside the application at the specified index.

[NOTE]
--
* A valid `INDEX` is a positive integer that identifies an existing `resume`.
* The exported `.pdf` file
will be located in the same folder as the application `.jar` file.
--

****
*Format:* `rgen INDEX [n/ FILE_NAME]`
****

[TIP]
--
* It is optional to specify a `FILE_NAME` for the .pdf file.
* If no name is specified, the filename will be set, by default, to the name of the generated `Resume`.
--

*Example:* Let's try out the following commands!

. `list i/ res`
. `rgen 1 n/ My Resume`

*Outcome:*

. The first command lists out all `resumes`. Assuming that you want to generate the first `resume` in the list box.
+
image::ListResume.PNG[width="790"]

. The second command generate a `My Resume.pdf` file from the specified resume. The screenshots of what happened are as below:
+
image::GenerateResume.PNG[width="790"]
image::PdfFile.PNG[width="790"]

// end::rgen[]

=== Clearing all data: `clear`
Clears all data from *ResuMe*.

****
*Format:* `clear`
****

[WARNING]
This command cannot be undone. Please be careful when exercising this power.


=== Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

****
*Format:* `exit`
****

=== Saving the data
*ResuMe* data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command
that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

=== Encrypting data files `[coming in v2.0]`
_{explain how the user can enable/disable data encryption}_
// end::dataencryption[]
