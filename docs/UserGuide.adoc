== Introduction

Hello fellow University friends! Have you ever found writing resumes
for job and internship applications a hassle? Have you ever dreamt about
an app that can help you manage different resumes for different companies?
Have you ever wished for a more streamlined *Command Line Interface*
application that can match your efficiency and typing prowess?

If this sounds like you, *ResuMe* is _the_ resume managing application for you!
Made by University students for University students with _looovee_, this wonder
understands your struggle and strives to cater to your specific resume needs
and job application woes.

=== Overview
*ResuMe* allows the management of four different item types:

[source,sh]
[cols="10%,10%,20%,60%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|No. |Item type |Alias |Attributes
|1 |internship |int |name, role, from, to, description, tag

|2 |project |proj |name, time, website, description, tag

|3 |skill |ski |name, level, tag

|4 |resume |res |name, description, tag
|=======================================================================

As you may have noticed from number 4, we are able to manage different resumes as well!
(As if this is not the whole reason why we decided to build this app in the firs place :D)
Items from number 1 to 3 can be shared across different resumes.

=== Preview
The following is the GUI for our application:

image::GUI.png[width="790"]

****
The GUI includes:

1. Command box: where you enter your commands.

2. Result box: where the result of a command is shown. It can show a success message or a failure
message if something wrong happens.

3. View box: where the detailed information is shown if needed. For instance, if you are viewing an
internship item, this box shows in full the item's name, timing, description, and other pieces of information.

4. List box: where all items of a type are listed. Only a type is displayed at a time. You can change
the view of this list. Also, when a command results in the change of one or more items of an item type,
the list box will be set to displaying that type.

5. User box: where you can view your information like name, email address, or phone number. If you make any update
that change will be reflected.

.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* **`list`**`i/ res` : lists all resumes
* **`add`**`i/ res n/ Software Engineering Resume #/SE #frontend`: adds a resume named `Software Engineering Resume`.
* **`delete`**`1 i/ res` : deletes the 1st resume shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add i/ TYPE n/ NAME`,
`TYPE` and `NAME` are parameters which can be used as `add i/ proj n/ Orbital`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/ NAME [#/TAG]` can be used as `n/ Orbital #/ SE` or as `n/ Orbital`.
* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[\#/ TAG]...`
can be used as (i.e. 0 times), `#/ friend`, `\#/ friend`, `#/ family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/ NAME p/ PHONE`,
`p/ PHONE_NUMBER n/ NAME` is also acceptable.

[NOTE]
`edit` is a different command from `redit`. Please visit <<FAQ>> for more information.

**Format:**

****
`edit INDEX i/ TYPE [ATTRIBUTE/ VALUE]... [#/ TAG]...`
****


[width="100%",cols="16%,84%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Type |Format

=== Finding items by name: `find`

Finds items in the ResuMe application whose names contain the specified keyword(s).

[NOTE]
An item could be one of the four item types: `internship`, `project`, `skill` or even a `resume` itself.

**Format:**

****
`find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]... i/ TYPE`
****

The specific command syntax could be found in the table below:

[width="100%",cols="12%,88%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Type |Format
|Internship | `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]... i/ int`

|Project |`find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]... i/ proj`

. `find Duke i/ proj`

*Outcome*

. Projects with matching name with keywords are listed in the list panel.
+
image::find_command.png[width="790"]

// tag::delete[]

=== Deleting an item : `delete`

Deletes an item from the ResuMe application.

**Format:**

****
`delete INDEX i/ TYPE`
****

`INDEX` : the positional index of the item. Use `list TYPE` with the same item type to view this list.

`TYPE`  : the item type.

[NOTE]
The `INDEX` argument comes before the `TYPE` argument.

[TIP]
Use `list` command to navigate to the correct list to ensure that 1) the item exists, and 2) you know the
correct index for deletion. Or just fall back on `undo`.

Deleting an item will set the list window to display items of its type.
If the item is an internship, a project, or a skill, all resumes that contain it will also be updated to
reflect the change.

*Examples:*

. Suppose we start with the following original list of resumes, as seen using the command `list i/ res`.
+

image::BeforeDeleteResumeList.png[width="790"]

. Deletes the 2nd resume with `delete 2 i/ res` .
+

image::ResumeDelete2.png[width="790"]

. Deletes the 3rd skill with `delete 3 i/ ski` . Do note how it is not a must for the list box to display skills for
deletion to proceed.
+

image::DeleteSkill3.png[width="790"]

// end::delete[]

// tag::view[]
=== Viewing an item in details: `view`

Shows the details of an item.

**Format:**
****
`view INDEX i/ TYPE`
****

[TIP]
The details of some item types like `proj` can only be viewed by using this command.

*Example:* Try typing in the command box these two commands one by one!

. `list i/ proj`
. `view 2 i/ proj`

*Outcome:*

. All project items are listed in the list panel.
+
image::ListProject2.png[width="790"]
. Using the `view` command, we can view the details of the project such as its website ("abc.github.io") and its description ("For a little module named CS2103T").
+
image::ViewDukeProject.png[width="790"]

// end::view[]

// tag::redit[]
=== Editing a resume: `redit`
Edits the resume to contain the items specified in the command.

[NOTE]
`redit` is a different command from `edit`. Please visit <<FAQ>> for more information.

**Format:**

****
`redit RESUME_INDEX TYPE/ [ITEM_INDEX...] [MORE_TYPE/ [ITEM_INDEX...]]`
****
[TIP]
If you find it a hassle to manually enter items into the resume, you can consider using <<Pulling tagged items into the resume: `tagpull`, tagpull>>!

* For each `TYPE`, existing items will be updated to the input items.
* You can add multiple items of a certain type to a resume by chaining
`ITEM_INDEX` after `TYPE/`  e.g. `proj/ 3 6`, will add item of indices 3 and 6.
* You can remove all items of type `TYPE` by
typing `TYPE/` without specifying any `ITEM_INDEX` after it.

*Examples:*

* `redit 1 int/ 1 proj/ 1 ski/ 1 2` +
This command modifies the resume at index 1. It changes the resume to contain the internship item at index 1, project item at index 1, and skill item at indices 1 and 2. The following screenshot illustrates what can happen:

image::ReditAddIntoResume.png[][AddIntoResume,442,337]


* `redit 1 int/ proj/ ski/` +
This command modifies the resume at index 1. It changes the resume to contain no internship, project, and skill items. The following screenshot illustrates what can happen:

image::ReditRemoveEverything.png[][RemoveEverything,442,337]

* `redit 1 int/ 1 proj/ ski/ 2` +
This command modifies the resume at index 1. It changes the resume to contain internship item at index 1, no project items, and skill item at index 2. The following screenshot illustrates what can happen (take note that initially the resume may contain other set of items entirely):

image::ReditWantSomeThings.png[][WantSomeThings,442,337]

// end::redit[]

// tag::tagpull[]
=== Pulling tagged items into the resume: `tagpull`

Pull the internship, project and skill items with the specified tag(s) into a resume.

**Format:**

****
`tagpull INDEX [#/ TAG]`
****

This command does not remove items from the resume and will add items on top of existing items.

Examples:

* `tagpull 1 #/ tech` +
This command modifies the resume at index 1. It will find all the internship, project, and skill items with the tag `tech` and adds it into the resume.

* `tagpull 2 #/ tech frontend` +
This command modifies the resume at index 2. It will find all the internship, project, and skill items which has either the tag `tech` or `frontend` and adds it into the resume.

// end::tagpull[]

// tag::undo[]

=== Undo a command: `undo`

Undoes the previous command and restores the state of the application to before that command is performed.

**Format:**

****
undo
****

Commands that can be undone are: `add`, `delete`, `edit`, `redit`, and `me`.

Successive undo commands will bring the application further back, until there is no more change to undo.

[NOTE]
--
* An undo is done per command and not change.

* Commands that make no change to the application state, like `list` or `view`, cannot be undone.

* You cannot undo if there is no previous state to return to.
--

*Examples:*

. Suppose we hate Java and therefore want to delete it from the list of skills using a `delete 2 i/ ski` command. We
also do a `list i/ proj` to switch to viewing projects because this is how staging for an example works.
+

image::deleteJava_beforeUndo.png[width="790"]
+

image::beforeUndo_switchToProj.png[width="790"]

. But Stockholm's syndrome kicks in and we decide that Java has its merits, so we revert our action with `undo`.
Voila, Java is back, and our list box now displays skills.
+

image::postUndo_JavaIsBack.png[width="790"]

// end::undo[]

// tag::redo[]

=== Redo a command: `redo`

Reverts the most recent undone command and brings the application state to after the (re)execution
of that command.

**Format:**

****
redo
****

[NOTE]
--
* A redo is done per command and not change.

* If a new `add`, `delete`, `edit`, `redit`, or `me` command is performed after an undo, then all redo states will be deleted and you will not be able to go
to these states.
* You cannot redo if there is no forward state to go to.
--

*Examples:*

. After with the Java deletion incidence in the previous section (on `undo`), we decide that the merits of Java
do not warrant the pain that comes along with it and so we want to use `redo` our original choice . Afterwards, Java is
once again removed from our life.
+

image::redo_success.png[width="790"]

// end::redo[]

=== Previewing a resume: `rpreview`

Previews a resume in text format in a different window.

**Format:**
****
`rpreview INDEX`
****

[NOTE]
`INDEX` is with respect to the index seen when `list i/res` is called.

*Examples:*

* `rpreview 2` +
Shows preview of the resume with at index 2.

*Outcome:*

Suppose we run the above command using the so far used example program. `rpreview 2` will provide a text-based view of
the content of the resume named "Summer Internship".

image::RPreviewSummerInternship.png[width = "790"]

// tag::rgen[]

=== Generating a resume: `rgen`
Generates a .pdf file from an existing resume stored inside the application at the specified index.

The exported `.pdf` file
will be located in the same folder as the application `.jar` file.

[NOTE]
A valid `INDEX` is a positive integer that identifies an existing resume.

**Format:**

****
`rgen INDEX [n/ FILENAME]`
****

[TIP]
It is optional to specify a `FILENAME` for the .pdf file.
If no name is specified, the filename will be set, by default, to the name of the generated `Resume`.

*Example:* Let's try out the following commands!

. `list i/ res`
. `rgen 1 n/ My Resume`

*Outcome:*

. The first command lists out all resumes. Assuming that you want to generate the first resume in the list.
+
image::ListResume.PNG[width="790"]

. The second command generate a `My Resume.pdf` file from the specified resume. The screenshots of the generated file is as below:
+
image::GenerateResume.PNG[width="790"]
image::PdfFile.PNG[width="790"]

// end::rgen[]

=== Clearing all data: `clear`
Clears all data from ResuMe.

****
Format: `clear`
****

[WARNING]
This command cannot be undone. Please be careful when exercising this power.


=== Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

****
Format: `exit`
****

=== Saving the data
ResuMe data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command
that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

=== Encrypting data files `[coming in v2.0]`
_{explain how the user can enable/disable data encryption}_
// end::dataencryption[]
